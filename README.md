#  SQL Data Exploration

In this project, I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to analyze and explore COVID-19 data that was sourced from [![our world]([https://img.shields.io/badge/my_portfolio-000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ko-fi&logoColor=white](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths))](https://katherineoelsner.com/)
in Data and had a duration of 1 January 2020 to 5 November 2022. The COVID-19 pandemic has had numerous short- and long-term effects on human health, society, economy, and environment. A pandemic that broke out in 2019 created significant knock-on effects on citizens' daily lives as well as the global economy. Nowadays, the impacts of COVID-19 on daily life are extensive and have far-reaching consequences.

Firstly, I Cleaned Data in SQL Queries by removing Duplicates, then, standardized Date Format by populate Property Address data, breaking out Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State) and Change Y and N to Yes and No in "Sold as Vacant" field
